# Episteme

> **Episteme turns inquiry into persistent, evolving understanding.**
> Episteme 让探索沉淀为可持续演化的理解。

Episteme is open cognitive infrastructure for carrying, organising and evolving _human
understanding_. It is not a chat assistant, a knowledge base, a course generator or a forum.

The problem it addresses is not "how do we let an AI answer faster", but:

> How do we make the understanding produced while exploring a question, learning something,
> discussing it or researching it — structured, kept, branched, corrected, compared and
> reused, so that it keeps shaping how people and AI interact later?

The system's most valuable asset is not a chat log and not course content. It is a
**cognitive graph that keeps evolving**, because a lesson learned, an argument had, a doubt
raised or a position revised can each change that graph.

```text
Question
    ↓
Exploration
    ↓
Understanding
    ↓
State change
    ↓
Persistent cognitive graph
    ↓
Future interaction changes
```

We care less about producing more answers than about making the process of understanding something that can
be recorded, verified, reused and continually corrected.

## What "structured understanding" means

A note, a knowledge base or a RAG index stores **material**: text that may be retrieved later. Episteme stores
what a particular person has come to understand from that material, as structure:

- **units**: concepts, questions, claims and evidence, each with where it came from;
- **relations**: what answers what, what supports or contradicts what, and which claim revises an earlier one;
- **state**: how sure the person is, whether they can explain it, whether it conflicts with something else,
  as separate dimensions rather than one score;
- **history**: every change kept as an event, so "I used to think this, and now I think that" can be read back.

What was submitted to be read, a learning material or an excerpt of a conversation, is kept beside the graph
as a source, never in it. Conversations are kept the same way: their raw turns are an archive only their owner
reads, beside the graph and never in it, and only their summaries can be shared
([ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-threads-and-scene-records.md)). Nothing an agent infers becomes part of
the graph until the person decides on it. The graph records what the person accepted as a description of
their understanding at that time. It does not prove they have mastered anything.

## Status: v0.1.0, a developer preview

v0.1.0, _First Real Learning Loop_, is the first version whose whole loop is built and tested end to end:

```text
Agent A submits candidate understanding, quoting the words it rests on
  → Episteme verifies each quote against the stored source and keeps the source
  → the learner reviews: accepts, modifies or dismisses
  → only what they accept enters the graph
  → Agent B, in another session, recalls it
```

It is a **developer preview**, not a stable release for general users. Automated tests prove the loop with
scripted MCP clients. It has **not yet been tried with a real Claude Code host and a real learner**, and
several protections are still missing; see [Limitations](#limitations-in-v010). The release notes say exactly
what is proven and what is not: [docs/releases/v0.1.0.md](docs/releases/v0.1.0.md).

**`pnpm serve`** starts the Episteme service and a local interface where a learner asks a question in their
own words, sees which of their own prior understanding was retrieved **and why**, records what they now
understand, reviews what agents suggested, and watches what is recalled next change because of it. Agents
reach the same graph over MCP: they can recall, propose and submit readings of material, and MCP gives them no
way to confirm anything (the REST review API is not yet protected; see [Limitations](#limitations-in-v010)).
Everything is written to one SQLite file per graph and survives closing the process.

![The Learn surface](docs/images/learn-surface.png)

Core and the layers above it run and are tested with **no model server, no language model and no frontend
toolchain**; only the one SQLite file per graph is needed once a graph has to survive a restart. The proofs of the
loop are the suites in `tests/`, such as `tests/northstar.test.ts`.

## Install the desktop program

The desktop program carries its own runtime and the learning workbench, keeps the service running in the tray,
and needs no Node or pnpm. Once a release is published:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiarong-Song233/Episteme/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex   # Windows
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiarong-Song233/Episteme/main/scripts/install.sh | sh   # macOS, Linux
```

Or tell your agent: _"按照 https://github.com/Jiarong-Song233/Episteme/blob/main/docs/install.md 帮我安装 Episteme"_.
Both scripts check the package against the release's `SHA256SUMS` and install for the current user only. See
[docs/install.md](docs/install.md). To build it yourself: `pnpm --filter @episteme/desktop build` (needs Rust).

## Quick start

Requires Node >= 22.13 and pnpm 11 (`corepack enable`, or a standalone pnpm). Windows, macOS and Linux all work;
Windows is tested in CI.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check              # typecheck + lint + build + tests
pnpm serve --help       # every option of the service
pnpm serve --graph "$HOME/.episteme/my-topic.db" --blank
```

`pnpm serve` serves MCP and the REST API. It serves a browser page only when given a built Workspace with
`--workspace <dir>`. Keep your own graph outside the repository. The default is `~/.episteme/learn.db`.

### The learning workbench, as an app

```bash
pnpm workbench          # builds the page, then serves it at http://127.0.0.1:4322
```

Open that address in Edge or Chrome and choose **Install** (the icon at the right of the address bar, or
_Apps → Install this site as an app_). It then opens in its own window from the Start menu or Dock, like any
desktop program. The service still has to be running: the window keeps only the page itself, so it can open
and say it cannot reach the service, but your material and understanding are always read from the service and
never stored by the browser. Installing needs `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` or HTTPS.

The personal route's plan and honest state are in
[personal-goal-plan](docs/roadmap/personal-goal-plan.md) and [personal-progress](docs/roadmap/personal-progress.md).

## Connecting an agent

The service prints its MCP address, by default `http://127.0.0.1:4321/mcp`. Any MCP host that speaks
Streamable HTTP can be pointed at it; there is no stdio shim yet. An agent gets four tools:

| tool      | what it does                                                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recall`  | the learner's prior understanding relevant to a question, with why each item was retrieved           |
| `propose` | a claim, a link or a state change, kept as a pending suggestion                                      |
| `reflect` | what the learner has recorded, grouped by what needs attention next                                  |
| `distill` | a stretch of material or dialogue, read by Episteme, or by the host's own model with verified quotes |

None of them confirms anything: MCP offers no confirm tool, and the learner decides in the Workspace the
service serves at `/`. That is a property of the MCP surface only. The REST review API behind the Workspace is
not authenticated, so an agent with shell access could still call it and confirm its own proposal (see
[Limitations](#limitations-in-v010)). For Claude
Code, the command would be the one below, but **it has not been verified against a real Claude Code host yet**:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http episteme http://127.0.0.1:4321/mcp
```

See [packages/mcp](packages/mcp/README.md) for the tools, the identity an agent is recorded under, and what
verification does and does not show.

## Using it

The loop is:

```text
ask in your own words
  → see which of your own prior understanding was retrieved, and the contribution of each signal
  → record how well you understand one of those things
  → ask again, and see the two answers side by side
```

Before you record anything the answer has to establish the ground. After, it starts from what you said you
understood. The interface shows the change as a comparison rather than asserting it, and shows the scoring
weights so the ranking is checkable rather than authoritative.

You can ask in **Chinese or English**; one graph serves both.

`reflect` answers _"what have I understood so far?"_ — grouping everything you have recorded into what needs
attention next (an unresolved conflict, a missing foundation, something you believe but cannot explain yet) and
what is already buildable.

The rule that keeps this honest:

> **Core only does what the graph itself must do.**

Recommendation, voting, hot-ranking, course generation, quizzes, reputation, leaderboards,
moderation, agent workflows, UI state and teaching strategy belong to a Domain Extension or an
Application. Putting any of them in Core would stop one ontology from serving Learn, Forum and
Research at once.

## Core ideas

**One graph, many views.** Learn, Forum and Research do not maintain separate knowledge
systems. They share one graph and project different views of it, differing by scope, actor,
topic, state and projection rule — not by data model.

**Understanding is not a mastery score.** There is no `mastery = 0.73`. State is a small set
of independent axes — `exposure`, `confidence`, `evidence`, `articulation`, `transfer`,
`conflict`, `source` — each moving on its own schedule. A learner can be confident and unable
to articulate, or fluent and full of unresolved conflict, and collapsing that into one number
would destroy exactly the information the system exists to keep.

**History is the truth.** Nothing is overwritten. There is no `claim.status = "understood"`
that buries what came before. Current state is `reduce(events)` over an append-only,
branchable event log, so cognitive history naturally forms a DAG and "I used to understand it
this way" is a first-class, queryable fact.

**Forking is first-class.** `fork(historyNode)` continues from a point in the past without
touching it, which requires interaction history to be a graph rather than an append-only
message list. A conversation is a view; the graph is the substrate.

**Draft → Thought → Reference.** Not all content is understanding. A raw AI transcript is a
draft and stays out of the graph until a human deliberately organises it. A `thought` must
carry a source and at least one anchor. A `reference` is public, sourced and verified — not
"absolute truth", just public knowledge with a traceable context and verification record.

**AI is a cognitive scaffold, not the author of the user's thinking.** An agent may ask
questions, offer counterexamples, suggest claims, concepts, edges, state changes and
syntheses. Everything it infers is `suggested` until the human accepts, modifies or ignores
it. An agent may never write to the graph or decide which side of a conflict is right.

**Conflict does not disappear.** If two claims contradict, Episteme preserves the conflict
with both authors, sources, evidence, times and states. Its job is to keep the structure of
disagreement, not to pretend knowledge is naturally consistent.

**Private by default, contributed deliberately.** Personal state events and claims are
private; concepts and references are public or controlled; contribution is an explicit
opt-in.

## Limitations in v0.1.0

- **No real host yet.** Host-assisted distillation works with scripted MCP clients in tests. No real Claude
  Code session and no real learner have used it, and compatibility with any particular agent host is not
  verified.
- **Deciding needs the person's token, but a same-user agent can read it.** An agent's token cannot decide,
  and a decision without the person's token is refused. An agent that runs as you, with a shell, can still use
  your token: run such agents with a host policy that forbids calling the decision routes
  ([ADR 0012](docs/decisions/0012-human-review-security.md)).
- **The Workspace does not show a suggestion's basis or speaker** yet. The data is in the API
  ([#26](https://github.com/SAIR-club/Episteme/issues/26)).
- **Retrieval uses a deterministic embedding adapter.** A question phrased very differently from what was
  recorded may not reach it.
- **`not_pending` in a retry receipt is not "dismissed".** Dismissals leave no record
  ([#25](https://github.com/SAIR-club/Episteme/issues/25)).
- **Unencrypted local storage.** A graph, with its drafts and sources, is a SQLite file on disk, with no
  encryption and no authentication. Do not expose the service to a network.
- **Anything on your machine can add to a local graph.** In local mode, reading, proposing, and creating spaces
  and materials need no credential, and the total has no limit, so a stray script can pile up data. Web
  pages from elsewhere are refused, and deleting, archiving, renaming and replacing need your token. A token would
  add little here, since a process running as you can open the graph file anyway
  ([ADR 0020](docs/decisions/0020-scene-route-capabilities.md)).
- **An export is the whole graph, in plain JSON.** `pnpm workbench export` works on the file and asks for no
  credential; in a shared deployment it holds everyone's data. It is written readable only by its owner, except on
  Windows, where it takes its folder's permissions. Its checksum catches damage, not editing, so import only files you
  trust.

Scope creep is the main risk to this project, so the following are explicitly out of scope for
now: multi-agent systems, recommendation engines, automatic curriculum generation, reputation,
leaderboards, semantic auto-merge, AI truth oracles, automatic knowledge-graph generation,
federation, institutional deployment, payments, complex governance, educational-effect
experiments, and full Lean integration.

Episteme ships no model of its own. The host's agent supplies the model, and `packages/agent` keeps a scripted
mock as the deterministic test double the loop's proofs depend on ([ADR 0008](docs/decisions/0008-agent-plugin-surface.md)).

## What comes next

Episteme's side of the shared service is in place: identity, visibility, publications, threads and scene records,
delegated confirmation and layered recall. This personal repository now builds an independently runnable AI
learning workbench on it, with its plan and state in [personal-goal-plan](docs/roadmap/personal-goal-plan.md) and
[personal-progress](docs/roadmap/personal-progress.md).

## Technical principles

Simple, typed, modular, testable and replaceable — rather than clever, complex or prematurely
distributed. TypeScript, a pnpm workspace monorepo, Vitest, ESLint and Biome (formatting only).

The domain model runs and is tested **without a frontend, without an LLM and without a
database**. That is a design constraint, not an accident: it is what allows the ontology to
outlive any particular product surface.
